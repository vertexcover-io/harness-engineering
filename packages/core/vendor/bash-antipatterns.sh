# PreToolUse hook for Bash tool - detects anti-patterns and reminds Claude
# to use built-in tools instead of shell commands
#
# Two-tier classification:
#   1. Scoping-sensitive read/write anti-patterns (cat/head/tail reads,
#      echo/printf/cat writes, sed -i, task-output reads) are classified
#      STRUCTURALLY with ast-grep (tree-sitter-bash). A real parse gives distinct
#      AST node shapes for "cat reading a file" vs "cat in a pipeline" vs
#      "cat <<EOF" vs "cat > file" vs a `cat` mentioned inside a string/heredoc —
#      distinctions the old regex path faked with three pre-stripping passes and a
#      remote-exec guard, and repeatedly got wrong (#1701, #1721, #1722, #1848,
#      #1900, #2052, #2058). These are STYLE nudges: when ast-grep is absent
#      (sandboxes, subagents) they simply do not fire. There is no regex twin.
#   2. Safety / correctness blocks (curl|bash, chmod 777, git add -A, reset
#      --hard, push -u footgun, block-device writes, fork bombs, git index-lock
#      chains, grep-chain test-output scrapes, awk/cat-to-commit-file) stay
#      pure-regex and fire in EVERY context — they must not depend on a binary
#      that may be missing.

# Strip trailing shell comments (an unquoted `#` at a word boundary through end
# of line) from the scanned view of the command, so a tool idiom that appears
# only inside a `# comment` — documentation prose, an explanatory aside such as
# `python3 … # /tmp is allowed for sed -i` — is not mistaken for an executed
# command (issue #2106). The detectors below care about what the shell would
# EXECUTE, and the shell discards comments before executing; this is the same
# class as the echo/printf quoted-`>` false positives (#1701/#1721/#1722) and
# the ls demotion (#2036).
#
# A `#` starts a comment ONLY when it is at the start of the line OR immediately
# preceded by whitespace or a shell metacharacter (`;`, `|`, `&`, `(`), AND is
# not inside single or double quotes. A `#` glued to a preceding word char
# (`http://x#frag`, `foo#bar`) is part of a token, and a `#` inside quotes
# (`echo "# not a comment"`) is literal text — neither is stripped. Quote state
# is tracked per line (a shell comment is a per-line construct), so an unbalanced
# quote on one line cannot swallow the next. The single-quote character is passed
# in via -v SQ so the awk program can stay single-quoted for the shell.

# Blank the CONTENT of every quoted span, keeping the quote characters, the span
# length, and any `$` inside it. Same per-line `in_s`/`in_d` scanner as
# strip_trailing_comments above — generalised here into a second consumer so the
# regex detectors that must tell "a shell operator" from "a character inside a
# quoted argument" get a quote-STATE-aware view instead of another naive
# pre-stripping pass. A `sed "s/'[^']*'/''/g"` cannot do this job: an odd
# apostrophe earlier on the line (`printf "it's done"`) or the `'\''` re-quoting
# idiom desynchronises it and it swallows the rest of the line, silently
# disarming whatever detector reads the view. The file header (#1701, #1721,
# #1722, #1848, #1900, #2052, #2058) is a list of exactly that mistake.
#
# What survives, and why:
#   - the quote characters themselves — the redirect STRUCTURE
#     (`awk '...' f > "$o"` becomes `awk '____' f > "$_"`) has to stay readable
#   - one FILL char per masked char — offsets stay aligned, so a regex that
#     cares about what sits immediately after `>` still sees the same position
#   - `$` — the "is the redirect target a variable?" test keys on a `$` right
#     after the opening quote, and masking it would silently change that test
# Everything else inside quotes — `>`, `|`, `;`, `&`, `(`, flag-looking words —
# becomes FILL, because inside quotes it is text, not shell syntax.
#
# Backslash handling matches the shell: outside quotes and inside double quotes a
# backslash escapes the next character (so `\'` and `\"` do not toggle state);
# inside single quotes it is literal. Quote state is tracked per line, so an
# unbalanced quote on one line cannot swallow the next.

# Strip heredoc body content up front so the regex detectors below that scan the
# whole command string don't false-positive on literal text inside a heredoc
# body. The main offender is `gh pr create --body "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` whose
# body may contain example shell commands (e.g. a log-stream pipeline) that are
# documentation, not executable code. (Consumed by the log-stream and grep-chain
# regex detectors, and by the four `^`-anchored safety blocks — the read/write
# detectors moved to the AST path, which understands heredoc-body nodes natively.)
#
# `^`-ANCHORED DETECTORS MUST SCAN THIS VIEW (issue #2431).
#
# `^` in grep anchors to the start of every LINE, not the start of the command.
# In a multi-line command a heredoc BODY line that happens to begin with a
# watched word is therefore matched as if it were the command itself. The
# reported break: a `git commit -F - <<EOF` whose message described a
# *connection timeout* was blocked with "REMINDER: The 'timeout' command is
# usually unnecessary — remove the timeout wrapper". There was no wrapper; the
# word was prose in the commit message. Same shape for `git add -A` /
# `git reset --hard` / `git push -u …` documented inside an issue or PR body.
#
# The per-line anchoring itself is correct and is preserved: a genuine command on
# line 2 of a multi-line Bash call IS the start of a command and must still be
# caught. Only heredoc-body lines are removed from the scanned view.
#
# The awk program walks the command line-by-line. When it sees `<<DELIM` it
# enters heredoc mode and suppresses subsequent lines until it sees a line
# matching DELIM. The heredoc-opening line itself is still printed, so a real
# command sharing that line (and every line after the terminator) still matches.

# Strip trailing `#` comments from the heredoc-stripped view (issue #2106). Done

# off those views (head/tail, sed -i, echo/printf → file, cat > file,
# task-output, git chains) becomes comment-immune in one place.
#
# COMMAND_NO_HEREDOC (heredoc-stripped, comments INTACT) is kept as a separate

# ── Structural read/write classification (ast-grep --lang bash) ───────────────
#
# The scoping-sensitive read/write detectors are classified via tree-sitter-bash.
# A read command inside `ssh host <<EOF … EOF`, `ssh host 'ls|grep'`, or
# `kubectl exec … -- cat` is a heredoc-body / string / argument node — never a
# command_name — so the remote-exec guard (#1900) is unnecessary: those forms are
# never mis-detected in the first place. A `cat`/`sed -i` MENTIONED inside a
# quoted string or heredoc body (#2052, #2058) is likewise not a command node.
#
# ast-grep is a single fast binary but is NOT assumed present (PreToolUse hooks
# fire in sandboxes and subagents). When it is absent these STYLE nudges simply
# do not fire — losing a "use Read instead of cat" steer where the parser is
# unavailable costs nothing irreversible, and the SAFETY blocks further down are
# pure-regex and fire in every context. Set
# CLAUDE_HOOKS_BASH_ANTIPATTERNS_NO_ASTGREP=1 to force the no-op path (tests).
#
# `sg` is ast-grep's short binary name, but it collides with shadow-utils'
# sg(1) ("execute command as different group ID"), which ships at /usr/bin/sg
# on essentially every Debian/Ubuntu system. A bare `command -v sg` finds THAT
# binary on any box that has shadow-utils but not the real ast-grep — which is
# most boxes, since ast-grep is an opt-in dev tool — and every structural rule
# below silently no-ops against it (issue #2451). Verify the resolved `sg`
# actually IS ast-grep before adopting it: `ast-grep --version` prints
# `ast-grep x.y.z`; shadow-utils' `sg --version` prints a usage line and exits
# non-zero, so this rejects it cleanly.
ASTGREP=""
if [ "${CLAUDE_HOOKS_BASH_ANTIPATTERNS_NO_ASTGREP:-}" != "1" ]; then
    if command -v ast-grep >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        ASTGREP="ast-grep"
    elif command -v sg >/dev/null 2>&1 && sg --version 2>/dev/null | grep -qi '^ast-grep'; then
        ASTGREP="sg"
    fi
fi

if [ -n "$ASTGREP" ]; then
    # Six rules, `---`-separated. Each keys on a distinct AST shape:
    #  - cat-read / head-tail-read: a read command with a (non-flag) file operand
    #    that is the WHOLE command — see the sole-statement gate below.
    #  - cat-write: a `cat` redirected to a real (non-/dev) file with NO source
    #    argument and NO heredoc (a heredoc write is the recommended body pattern).
    #  - echo-printf-write: an echo/printf file_redirect to a real (non-/dev)
    #    target; fd redirects like `2>/dev/null` carry a /dev destination and a
    #    redirect inside a sibling `$(…)` binds to that inner command, not the echo.
    #    Scratch destinations (/tmp, /private/tmp, /var/folders) are exempt: those
    #    writes usually capture `$!`/`$?`, which a Write call cannot (W38 friction).
    #  - sed-inplace: `sed -i`/`--in-place` whose operands do NOT include a
    #    scratch path (/tmp, /private/tmp, /var/folders) — scratch edits are fine.
    #  - task-output-read: cat/head/tail of a `.output`/`/tasks/` path, whole-command.
    #
    # SOLE-STATEMENT GATE on the three READ rules (issue #2148).
    #
    # The three read detectors fire only when the read IS the whole command:
    #   inside: { kind: program }                       — parent is the top level, so
    #     the read is not an arm of a `&&`/`||` list, not a stage of a pipeline
    #     (that parent is `pipeline`), not inside a subshell / substitution / body
    #   nthChild 1 forward AND reverse, ofRule "not a comment"
    #     — it is the ONLY statement of that program (a trailing `# comment` is a
    #       sibling node and is excluded from the count, so `cat f.md  # notes`
    #       still fires; `ls d/; cat f` does not)
    #
    # Why: #2114 replaced the regex path with this structural one and, as a side
    # effect nobody intended, WIDENED the catch surface from "a bare read as the
    # whole command" (the old `^\s*cat\s+…` + "no pipe anywhere" regex) to "a bare
    # read ANYWHERE in a compound command". The W31 friction reading measured the
    # cost: same-session repeat-block rate 15.2% → 46.3% (3.0× above a stable
    # six-reading 6.3–20.0% band), 70 events / 41 sessions, ~30% of all friction
    # events that week; per-session prevalence 21.6% → 68.3%. Of 72 recovered
    # blocked commands, ~47 (65%) did not begin with cat/head/tail and would have
    # passed pre-#2114.
    #
    # The repeat rate is the tell. For a bare `cat f.md` the substitution is clean
    # and one-to-one: Read(file_path=…). For `cd repo && git log -3 && cat p.json`
    # there is NO single-call substitution — the agent must decompose one Bash call
    # into a Bash call plus N Read calls and re-plan, so it re-attempts a variant
    # and is blocked again in the same session. Per hook-block-vs-nudge.md the
    # exit-2 is only earned where the substitution is clean; the compound case is
    # style with no clean fix, and style does not warrant a hard block.
    #
    # This restores the pre-#2114 scope (remedy (a) in #2148) rather than demoting
    # the whole steer (remedy (b), the find/#1871 · grep/#1909 · ls/#2036 ·
    # long-pipeline/#1873 path) — the block sat happily at 6–20% for six readings
    # at its narrow scope, so the minimal correct action is to revert the widening.
    #
    # The `not: { inside: { kind: pipeline, stopBy: end } }` clause the read rules
    # used to carry is GONE because `inside: { kind: program }` subsumes it: a read
    # in a pipeline has `pipeline` as its parent, never `program`. Pipelines and
    # heredocs remain exempt exactly as before (pinned by the test suite).
    #
    # The three WRITE detectors (cat-write, echo-printf-write, sed-inplace) keep
    # their original scope — they guard file MUTATION, not context budget, and
    # neither #2148 nor the friction data implicates them.

    # The `sed-inplace` AST rule's own scratch exemption requires the scratch path
    # to be a literal `word` node INSIDE the sed command. In practice agents `cd`
    # into the scratchpad first (or bind it to a variable), so sed's target is a
    # bare relative filename and the exemption never fires — the block message has
    # been promising "(In-place edits of scratch files under /tmp are allowed.)"
    # while blocking exactly that. W34 measured 6 events / 6 sessions, of which
    # 4 (67%) targeted /private/tmp scratchpaths the message declares exempt.
    #
    # So honour the documented exemption at the consumption site by also accepting
    # a scratch path established as a `cd` TARGET or as a variable VALUE. The AST
    # rule is correct as written and is deliberately left alone; widening it would
    # mean teaching the parser about shell state it cannot see.
    #
    # Deliberately NOT a blanket "the command mentions /tmp somewhere" test: that
    # would exempt `cd ~/repos/x && sed -i '' 's/a/b/' f.py 2>/tmp/log`, a repo
    # edit whose only /tmp is a log redirect, which must keep blocking.
    #
    # Scanned view is COMMAND_SHELL_ONLY (heredoc bodies and trailing `#` comments
    # already stripped), matching the other regex detectors below: a `cd /tmp/...`
    # that appears only inside a heredoc body or an explanatory comment is data,
    # not shell state, and must not grant the exemption (#2106's class).
    #
    # The `cd` branch ends in a BOUNDARY CLASS, not a trailing slash (W35
    # friction, Refs #2422). Requiring `(/private)?/tmp/` meant a bare
    # `cd /tmp && sed -i ...` — no subdirectory — never matched, so the
    # exemption the block message advertises was unreachable for that shape in

    # the bare form while still refusing `cd /tmpfoo`, which a bare prefix match

# Check for awk used for file modifications
#
# Condition 1 must confine the span between `awk` and the redirect to a SINGLE
# pipe segment (`[^|]*`, not `.*`). The old greedy `awk\s+.*>` crossed pipes, so
# a read-only `awk` upstream of a DOWNSTREAM redirect —
# `… | awk -F/ '{print $1}' | sort -u > "$f"`, where `sort` does the writing —
# was blocked as if awk were rewriting the file (issue #2131). The trailing
# `[^|]+` only ever constrained the chars AFTER `>`, never the span before it.
# That segment-confinement is retained below (widened to `[^|;&]*`); everything
# else about the rule changed in #2463.
#
# Condition 1 must also ignore a `>` that lives INSIDE the quoted awk PROGRAM.
# `awk 'NR>1{print $1}'` — the standard header-skipping idiom — is a comparison
# operator in awk's own language, not a shell redirect, but against raw command
# text the two are indistinguishable. Paired with condition 2 matching a redirect
# owned by a DIFFERENT command elsewhere in the same call (`"$S/run.sh" … >
# "$S/out.log"` on a later line), that blocked a read-only listing pipeline with
# advice — "use the Edit tool instead of awk" — that made no sense for it
# (issue #2463). Note the control: the identical command with `{print $1}` in
# place of `NR>1{print $1}` was already allowed, so the comparison operator was
# the sole trigger.
#
# Two changes, both folded into ONE regex over the quote-masked view
# (mask_quoted_content above), replacing the old pair of independent greps:
#
#  1. A `>` inside quotes is TEXT. The masked view blanks quoted content while
#     preserving the quote chars, the offsets, and `$` — so `awk 'NR>1{…}'`
#     becomes `awk '___________$__'` (no `>` left to mistake for a redirect)
#     while the true positive `awk '…' data.txt > "$out"` keeps its redirect
#     structure intact and still blocks. Same class as the echo/printf
#     quoted-`>` false positives (#1701/#1721/#1722), fixed the same way. This
#     deliberately does NOT use a `sed "s/'[^']*'/''/g"` pre-pass: that
#     desynchronises on an odd apostrophe (`printf "it's done"`) or on the
#     `'\''` re-quoting idiom and swallows the rest of the line, turning a
#     safety block into a silent no-op.
#
#  2. The two conditions become ONE regex, so "awk owns a redirect" and "the
#     target is a variable" must now hold in the SAME command segment.
#     Previously they were separate `grep` calls that could match on entirely
#     different lines — the actual mechanism of #2463, where condition 2 was
#     satisfied by `"$S/run.sh" … > "$S/out.log"` on a later line. The span is
#     confined by `[^|;&]*`: `|` was already there from #2131, and `;`/`&`
#     extend the same idea to `;`, `&&`, `||` and background `&`, which also
#     fixes the same-line shape (`… | awk 'NR>1{…}' && other > "$log"`) of the
#     class #2463 reported.
#
# This stays a pure-regex check rather than moving to the ast-grep classifier:
# the block belongs to the safety/correctness tier that must fire in EVERY
# context (sandboxes, subagents), and a structural rule fails open where the
# parser is absent. See the tier note in this file's header.
#
# Scanned view is COMMAND_SHELL_ONLY (heredoc bodies and trailing `#` comments
# already stripped), matching the `^`-anchored blocks (#2431) and the commit-file
# reminder below. #2463 reported this directly: diagnosing the rule and then
# DRAFTING THE ISSUE were both blocked, because a heredoc body quoting the
# offending shape was scanned as if it were an executed command. Prose is data.
#
# KNOWN GAP (pre-existing, not closed here): the segment barrier is characters,
# not structure, so a redirect living inside a `$( … )` between `awk` and a
# later `>` can still be read as awk's own, and a `\`-continued redirect on the
# next physical line is missed because grep is line-based.
# Capture, do not pipe: `grep -q` exits at the first match, and under

COMMON SCENARIO - Accidentally committed to main, then pushed to a PR branch:
Once the PR is merged on GitHub, the local main branch resolves itself cleanly
when you run 'git pull'. Wait for the merge, then pull.

Use these alternatives instead:
- Sync with remote after PR merge: use 'git pull' - it resolves everything
- Discard uncommitted changes: use 'git checkout -- <file>' or 'git restore <file>'
- Undo a local commit (not pushed): use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' (keeps changes staged)
- Switch branches cleanly: use 'git stash' then 'git checkout <branch>'

FOR THE 'ACCIDENTAL COMMIT TO MAIN' CASE: Wait for the PR to merge, then
'git pull' on main will fast-forward to include your commits. Problem solved.

IF THIS COMMAND IS TRULY REQUIRED (rare - corrupted git state):
Ask the user to run it manually with:
1. The exact command: $COMMAND
2. Why it's needed for this specific situation
3. What alternatives you tried"

# (git push origin main:feature/x) should carry NO -u.
#
# The no-colon form `git push -u origin feat/x` is intentionally NOT matched:
# it pushes the local feat/x ref and sets feat/x's upstream, never touching the
# current branch — the old detector wrongly blocked it on a false "sets main's
# tracking" premise, the same legitimate pattern as issue #1600.
#
# All four reads use COMMAND_SHELL_ONLY (issue #2431) so a heredoc-body line
# documenting the footgun — an issue body whose repro section literally reads
# `git push -u origin main:feat/x` — is not mistaken for the executed push. The
# guard conditions and the refspec extraction must share ONE view: under
# `set -e`, a `PUSH_REFSPEC=$(… grep -oE …)` that finds nothing exits non-zero
# and aborts the hook, so a guard matching a view the extraction doesn't would
# turn a false positive into a hook crash.

This is the main-branch development pattern: push to a remote feature branch WITHOUT -u:
  git push origin $CURRENT_BRANCH:$PUSH_DST

The -u flag is only correct when local and remote branch names match:
  git push -u origin $CURRENT_BRANCH  (pushes $CURRENT_BRANCH to origin/$CURRENT_BRANCH)"
